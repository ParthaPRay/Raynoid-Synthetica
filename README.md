# Raynoid-Synthetica
The "Raynoid Synthetica" model provides a novel and the first ever mathematical foundation for representing and understanding the dynamics of organoid intelligence (OI). Fusing the principles of artificial intelligence (AI) with the biological intricacies of organoids.

The Raynoid Synthetica model offers a comprehensive mathematical framework that captures the core essence of organoid intelligence. By bridging the gap between the biological intricacies of organoids and the structured realm of artificial intelligence, this model promises a new frontier in the understanding and simulation of life-like intelligence systems. Its adaptability and detailed representation make it a prime candidate for both theoretical exploration and practical application in the fields of AI and biology.
